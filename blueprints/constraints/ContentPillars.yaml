distribution_rules:
  weekly_minimum: 3
  weekly_maximum: 7
  ideal_weekly: 5
  pillar_balance_window: weekly
  description: "Track pillar distribution over rolling 7-day window, not per-post"

validation:
  check_pillar_balance:
    description: "Warn if any pillar exceeds +10% or falls below -10% of target over 7 days"
    severity: warning

  check_pillar_drift:
    description: "Error if any pillar exceeds +20% or falls below -20% over 30 days"
    severity: error

  min_posts_per_pillar:
    description: "Each pillar should have at least 1 post per 2 weeks"
    severity: warning

content_principles:
  - name: "Pillar determines framework choice"
    description: "what_building → STF/SLA, what_learning → MRS/SLA, sales_tech → STF/PIF, problem_solution → STF/SLA"

  - name: "Avoid pillar mixing in single post"
    description: "Each post should clearly belong to ONE pillar for clarity and focus"

  - name: "Rotate pillars over week"
    description: "Don't cluster all what_building posts on Monday - distribute across week"

  - name: "Pillar guides content depth"
    description: "what_building = specific project details, what_learning = concept deep-dive, etc."

examples:
  balanced_week:
    monday:
      pillar: what_building
      framework: STF
      topic: "Shipped blueprint validation system"

    tuesday:
      pillar: what_learning
      framework: MRS
      topic: "Learned async context managers the hard way"

    wednesday:
      pillar: sales_tech
      framework: STF
      topic: "AI coach improved discovery call performance"

  poor_balance:
    issue: "5 what_building posts, 0 sales_tech posts"
    consequence: "Audience sees only building content, misses sales expertise"
    fix: "Redistribute: 2 building, 1 learning, 1 sales, 1 problem-solution"
