description: Strategic framing decisions - which game are we playing and why?
version: 1.0

# Core strategic question: What's the primary goal RIGHT NOW?
current_goal:
  primary: get_hired  # Options: get_hired, build_community, both
  timeframe: 2-4 weeks  # How long until we reassess?
  success_criteria:
    - Land AI Engineer / Solutions Engineer / Sales Engineer role
    - Portfolio proof of production AI systems
    - Consistent shipping narrative (build in public)

# The Two Games
games:
  traffic:
    description: Optimize for discovery, reach, and growth
    goal: Get found by hiring managers and recruiters
    optimize_for: THEM (what hooks scroll-stoppers?)
    metrics:
      - Impressions
      - Engagement rate
      - Profile views
      - Follower growth
      - Click-throughs to portfolio
    framing_strategy:
      - Hook-first (problem or result they care about)
      - Universal insights (anyone can use this pattern)
      - No assumed context (explain what it is)
      - Actionable takeaways
      - Confidence without arrogance

  building_in_public:
    description: Document your work, attract like-minded builders
    goal: Show consistent shipping, build credibility through transparency
    optimize_for: YOU (what did I learn/build today?)
    metrics:
      - Did I capture the insight?
      - Did the right people find it?
      - Quality of replies/conversations
      - Collaboration opportunities
    framing_strategy:
      - Context-first (here's what I'm building)
      - Assume followers know the project
      - Raw and real (not polished)
      - Document process, not just wins
      - Vulnerability builds trust

# Platform-Specific Strategies
platforms:
  twitter:
    default_game: traffic
    why: |
      Discovery platform. Fast scroll. Hook or die.
      Timeline threads over time (not in one post).
    framing_rules:
      - Hook must work with ZERO context
      - 1-3 tweets max per thread (usually)
      - Insight-first, story optional
      - Each tweet stands alone
      - Universal problems > personal journey
    best_pillars:
      - what_learning (universal patterns)
      - problem_solution (specific fixes)
    when_to_build_in_public:
      - Major milestone announcements
      - Celebrating shipped features
      - Quick wins / "just shipped X"

  linkedin:
    default_game: both  # Can do traffic AND building in one post
    why: |
      Professional audience expects depth.
      STF framework = building in public WITH traffic appeal.
      Longer format allows context-setting.
    framing_rules:
      - Use STF/MRS/SLA frameworks (story structure)
      - 800-1200 chars allows context
      - Problem → Journey → Result → Lesson
      - Personal story + universal insight
      - Can mention projects by name
    best_pillars:
      - what_building (with STF framework)
      - sales_tech (unique expertise)
      - All 4 work well

  blog:
    default_game: building_in_public
    why: |
      Deep technical content for people already interested.
      SEO for long-tail discovery.
      Portfolio piece for hiring managers.
    framing_rules:
      - Assume reader chose to be here
      - Technical depth expected
      - Architecture over implementation
      - Link to GitHub/demos
      - Tutorial or deep-dive format
    best_pillars:
      - what_building (architecture posts)
      - what_learning (synthesis posts)

# Decision Framework: Which Game for This Post?
decision_tree:
  questions:
    - question: What's the current primary goal?
      answer_mapping:
        get_hired: Lean toward traffic (70/30)
        build_community: Lean toward building (30/70)
        both: Balanced (50/50)

    - question: Which platform?
      answer_mapping:
        twitter: Traffic unless major milestone
        linkedin: Both (use STF framework)
        blog: Building in public

    - question: Which pillar is this idea?
      answer_mapping:
        what_building: Can be either (use STF for both)
        what_learning: Traffic (universal insights)
        sales_tech: Traffic (unique expertise attracts)
        problem_solution: Traffic (specific solutions)

    - question: Do strangers care about this problem?
      answer_mapping:
        yes: Traffic framing
        no: Building in public framing
        unsure: Test both versions

# Framing Templates by Game

# Current Strategy (2026-01-17)
current_strategy:
  timeframe: Next 2-4 weeks
  primary_goal: get_hired
  distribution:
    traffic: 70%
    building_in_public: 30%

  platform_mix:
    twitter:
      frequency: 3-5x per week
      style: Traffic-optimized insights (1-3 tweets)
      pillars: what_learning (50%), problem_solution (30%), sales_tech (20%)

    linkedin:
      frequency: 2x per week (10 posts from Sunday Power Hour → approve 8-10)
      style: STF framework (traffic + building hybrid)
      pillars: All 4 (35/30/20/15 distribution)

    blog:
      frequency: 1x per week
      style: Deep technical architecture posts
      pillars: what_building (deep dives on ContentEngine, PAI, etc)

  success_indicators:
    - Profile views increasing
    - Hiring manager engagement (comments/DMs)
    - Can you explain how you built X? questions
    - Portfolio clicks from LinkedIn bio
    - Interview requests

# When to Reassess Strategy
reassessment_triggers:
  - Every 2-4 weeks (calendar reminder)
  - When primary goal changes (got hired? pivot to build_community)
  - When metrics plateau (try different game mix)
  - When new opportunity appears (Sales RPG funding? shift to building)

# Open Questions / Uncertainties
open_questions:
  - question: How do we automate the "which game" decision?
    current_approach: Manual decision per post during Sunday Power Hour
    ideal_state: Content Optimizer Agent suggests framing based on goal + platform + pillar

  - question: How do we measure if traffic framing is working?
    current_approach: Track impressions + profile views manually
    ideal_state: Analytics dashboard showing traffic vs building posts performance

  - question: Should we A/B test framings?
    current_approach: Intuition-based choices
    ideal_state: Same idea posted with both framings, measure which performs better

  - question: When do we know it's time to shift from get_hired to build_community?
    current_approach: After landing a stable job
    ideal_state: Gradual shift as job search progresses (70/30 → 50/50 → 30/70)

# Notes for Future Phases
future_enhancements:
  phase_4:
    - Brand Planner agent makes "which game" decision per post
    - Suggests optimal framing based on current_goal + platform + pillar
    - Outputs: "Use traffic framing, hook: problem-first, platform: Twitter"

  phase_5:
    - Content Optimizer auto-generates both versions (traffic + building)
    - A/B test framework (post version A, measure, iterate)
    - Learning loop: which framings perform best for each pillar?

  phase_6:
    - Engagement analytics feed back into strategy
    - Auto-adjust distribution based on what's working
    - "Traffic posts getting 3x engagement → shift to 80/20 mix"
