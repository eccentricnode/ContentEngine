characteristics:
  - id: technical_but_accessible
    description: Technical depth without jargon walls
    examples:
      - "Built a RAG system using Anthropic's API (good - specific tech, clear purpose)"
      - "Leveraged synergistic AI paradigms (bad - jargon without substance)"
    guidelines:
      - Use specific technology names (Python, Claude API, PostgreSQL)
      - Explain technical concepts in plain language
      - Assume audience is smart but not necessarily in your exact domain
      - Tech details support the point, don't obscure it

  - id: authentic
    description: Real experiences over generic advice
    examples:
      - "I failed 3 times before this approach worked (good - vulnerable, specific)"
      - "Success comes to those who persevere (bad - platitude, no substance)"
    guidelines:
      - Share actual numbers and results when possible
      - Admit mistakes and struggles openly
      - No humble-bragging disguised as vulnerability
      - Specific stories over vague principles

    guidelines:
      - Emphasize building over theorizing
      - Share what you shipped, not just what you learned
