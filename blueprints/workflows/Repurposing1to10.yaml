# Repurposing benefits
benefits:
  efficiency_multiplier: 10x content from 1 idea
  explanation: |
    Traditional approach: 10 separate ideas × 15 min each = 150 min
    Repurposing approach: 1 deep idea × 45 min development = 45 min
    Net savings: 105 minutes per batch
  additional_benefits:
    - Consistent core message across platforms
    - Platform-specific optimization for each piece
    - Deeper exploration of single valuable idea
    - Cross-promotion opportunities between platforms
    - Reinforcement of key insights through repetition
