description: Mistake-Realization-Shift Framework - Vulnerability-driven narrative showing personal growth
type: framework

structure:
  sections:
    - name: Mistake
      description: The error, bad assumption, or wrong approach you took
      guidelines:
        - Own it completely - no excuses or blame-shifting
        - Be specific about what you did wrong
        - Show the impact of the mistake
        - Make it relatable - others likely made similar mistakes
        - Vulnerability builds trust and engagement

    - name: Realization
      description: The moment you understood what was actually wrong
      guidelines:
        - What triggered the insight?
        - Often comes from failure, feedback, or data
        - Show the "aha moment" - make it visceral
        - Contrast with previous understanding
        - This is the turning point of the story

    - name: Shift
      description: How you changed your approach and what resulted
      guidelines:
        - Concrete actions you took differently
        - New mental model or framework you adopted
        - Measurable results or observable changes
        - What you do now vs what you did before
        - Make it actionable for readers

validation:
  min_sections: 3
  max_sections: 3
  min_chars: 500
  max_chars: 1300
  required_elements:
    - All three sections must be present
    - Clear causal chain (Mistake → Realization → Shift)
    - Personal vulnerability and authenticity
    - Specific examples (not generic "I was wrong about X")

compatible_pillars:
  - what_learning
  - problem_solution
  - sales_tech

examples:
  - title: "I Thought More Features = More Sales (I Was Wrong)"
    mistake: "Built my first SaaS with 47 features. Thought comprehensive = valuable. Spent 8 months. Launched to crickets. 3 signups, all friends who felt bad for me."
    realization: "Customer interview #23 changed everything. User said: 'I don't need 47 features. I need ONE thing that solves my actual problem perfectly.' Realized I was building what I thought was impressive, not what they needed."
    shift: "Next product: one feature. Did it exceptionally well. Talked to 50 users BEFORE writing code. Validated the pain was real. MVP took 3 weeks. Got 100 signups in first month. Now I kill features aggressively."

  - title: "Why I Stopped Working 80-Hour Weeks"
    mistake: "Thought grinding harder = success. Worked 80-hour weeks for 2 years. Wore it like a badge of honor. My close rate was 5%. I was exhausted, burned out, relationships suffering."
    realization: "My best month ever? I was sick, worked 20 hours total. Close rate was 15%. Realized I wasn't being productive, I was being busy. The work that mattered took 4 hours/day, not 16."
    shift: "Cut to 6-hour focused workdays. Eliminated meetings that didn't drive revenue. Built systems to handle repetitive tasks. Close rate went to 40%. Revenue doubled. Actually have a life now."

best_practices:
  - Lead with vulnerability - admit the mistake upfront
  - Use "I thought X, but Y" structure to show contrast
  - Quantify impact when possible (numbers make it real)
  - Make the mistake relatable (most people made similar errors)
  - Show the realization came from data/feedback, not just gut
  - Shift should be specific actions, not vague intentions
  - End with what you do now vs what you did then
  - Keep it conversational and authentic

anti_patterns:
  - Humble-bragging disguised as vulnerability ("My only mistake was working TOO hard")
  - Blaming others for the mistake (own it completely)
  - Vague mistakes ("I wasn't strategic enough" - too generic)
  - Missing the emotional impact of the mistake
  - Realization that comes from nowhere (show the trigger)
  - Shift that's just theory, not actual practice
  - Preachy tone (share your journey, don't lecture)
  - Making it about how smart you are now

voice_guidelines:
  - First-person narrative ("I", "my")
  - Honest and vulnerable without self-deprecation
  - Show growth, not perfection
  - Conversational tone (like telling a friend)
  - Specific details make it credible
  - Balance humility with confidence in the shift
  - Make it about the lesson, not the ego
