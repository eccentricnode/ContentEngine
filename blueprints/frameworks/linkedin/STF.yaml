description: Storytelling Framework - Problem, Tried, Worked, Lesson structure for authentic narrative content
type: framework

structure:
  sections:
    - name: Problem
      description: Identify the specific problem or challenge faced
      guidelines:
        - Be concrete and specific, not generic
        - Make it relatable to your audience
        - Focus on business/technical problems your audience faces
        - Use real examples from your experience

    - name: Tried
      description: What you attempted that didn't work
      guidelines:
        - Show vulnerability - what failed?
        - Multiple attempts build credibility
        - Explain why the obvious solution didn't work
        - Connect to common misconceptions

    - name: Worked
      description: The solution that actually solved the problem
      guidelines:
        - Specific tactics and approach
        - Why this was different from what you tried
        - Include concrete metrics or results if available
        - Technical details are good, keep them accessible

    - name: Lesson
      description: The takeaway and what you learned
      guidelines:
        - Actionable insight, not platitude
        - Connect to broader principle
        - What would you do differently next time?
        - Make it applicable to reader's situation

  required_elements:
    - All four sections must be present
    - Clear transition between sections
    - Specific examples (no generic advice)
    - First-person narrative voice

  - what_learning
  - problem_solution

examples:
  - title: "From 5% to 40% Close Rate Using AI"
    problem: "I was closing 5% of my sales calls. Terrible numbers. I knew product, had the pitch down, but something was off."
    tried: "Tried all the classics: objection handling scripts, Sandler method, SPIN selling. Read the books. Watched the videos. Still stuck at 5-7%."
    worked: "Built a custom AI system that analyzed my calls, identified patterns in successful vs failed closes, and gave me real-time coaching. Close rate jumped to 40% in 3 months."
    lesson: "Generic sales training teaches techniques. But YOUR specific gaps need YOUR specific solutions. AI can find patterns you can't see in your own performance."

  - title: "Why My First SaaS Failed (And What I'd Do Different)"
    problem: "Spent 6 months building a project management tool. Launch day: 3 signups. All friends. Zero revenue."
    tried: "Built more features. Better UI. More integrations. Surely the product just needed to be BETTER. Spent another 4 months. Still crickets."
    worked: "Talked to 50 potential users. Realized they didn't need another PM tool - they needed a way to stop context-switching between Slack/Asana/Email. Pivoted to a unified inbox. Got 100 signups in 2 weeks."
    lesson: "You can't code your way out of a problem-market fit issue. Talk to users BEFORE you build, not after you launch."

best_practices:
  - Start with a hook (the problem or the surprising result)
  - Use line breaks to separate sections visually
  - Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max)
  - Use specific numbers when possible (5% → 40%, not 'improved')
  - Avoid corporate jargon and buzzwords
  - Write like you're explaining to a smart friend
  - End with actionable takeaway, not motivational fluff

anti_patterns:
  - Generic advice that could apply to anyone
  - Vague language ("increased efficiency", "optimized workflow")
  - Missing the "Tried" section (makes it seem too easy)
  - Lesson that's just a restatement of the problem
  - Humble-bragging without vulnerability
  - Too long (LinkedIn users scroll fast)
  - No line breaks (wall of text kills engagement)

voice_guidelines:
  - First-person narrative ("I", "my", "we")
  - Conversational but professional
  - Technical depth where relevant, but accessible
  - Confident without being arrogant
  - Authentic - show the struggle, not just the win
  - Specific > Generic always
