# Ralph Progress Log - Content Engine Phase 3

**Project:** ContentEngine - Semantic Blueprints
**Started:** 2026-01-17
**Goal:** Implement blueprint system for content framework encoding, validation, and generation

## Codebase Patterns

**Package Manager:**
- Always use `uv run` prefix for Python commands
- Install dependencies: `uv add package-name`
- Sync environment: `uv sync`

**File Paths:**
- Use `pathlib.Path` and `os.path.expanduser()`
- Blueprint files: `blueprints/frameworks/`, `blueprints/workflows/`, `blueprints/constraints/`
- Templates: `blueprints/templates/`

**Database:**
- SQLAlchemy ORM with context managers
- Models in `lib/database.py`
- Use `with get_session() as session:` pattern
- Always call `session.commit()` explicitly

**YAML Blueprints:**
- Use PyYAML for parsing
- Cache loaded blueprints in memory for performance
- Validate YAML structure on load

**Testing:**
- pytest fixtures for test data in `conftest.py`
- Mock external dependencies (LLM, file system)
- Test both success and failure paths

**Key Files:**
- `lib/database.py` - Database models
- `lib/context_synthesizer.py` - Phase 2 context capture (already implemented)
- `cli.py` - CLI commands
- `tests/conftest.py` - Shared test fixtures

## Architecture Overview

**Phase 3 adds:**
1. Blueprint system (YAML-based content frameworks)
2. Validation engine (brand voice, platform rules)
3. Content generator (blueprint-driven LLM prompts)
4. Workflow executor (batching, repurposing)

**Integration with Phase 2:**
- Context from `synthesize_daily_context()` → Blueprint prompts → LLM generation

- Added comprehensive README.md explaining blueprint system architecture
- Created tests to verify directory structure

**Files changed:**
- blueprints/README.md (new)
- tests/test_blueprint_structure.py (new)

**Learnings:**
- Blueprint directory provides foundation for all YAML-based content frameworks

- Test ensures directory structure exists for subsequent blueprint file creation

**Tests:**
- mypy: PASS
- ruff: PASS
- pytest: PASS (2 new tests added)

**Commit:** 68a2264

## [2026-01-17] - CE-BP-002 - Implement blueprint_loader.py

**Implemented:**
- Created lib/blueprint_loader.py with comprehensive blueprint loading system
- load_framework(name, platform) - Load framework blueprints with platform support
- load_workflow(name) - Load workflow blueprints
- load_constraints(name) - Load constraint blueprints
- clear_cache() - Cache management (full and selective invalidation)
- list_blueprints() - Blueprint discovery across all categories
- In-memory caching with cache key pattern: "{type}:{platform}:{name}"

**Files changed:**
- lib/blueprint_loader.py (new)
- tests/test_blueprint_loader.py (new)
- pyproject.toml (added pyyaml, types-pyyaml)
- uv.lock (updated)

**Learnings:**
- PyYAML safe_load returns Any type - need cast() for mypy compliance
- Cache invalidation supports both full clear and selective key removal
- Monkeypatch in pytest allows mocking get_blueprints_dir() for testing
- YAML parsing errors need to be caught and re-raised with context
- Blueprint discovery walks directory structure to find all YAML files

**Tests:**
- 13 comprehensive tests covering:
  - Successful loading of all blueprint types
  - File not found error handling
  - Invalid YAML error handling
  - Cache behavior (hit/miss/invalidation)
  - Selective cache clearing
  - Blueprint listing (all and filtered)
- mypy: PASS
- ruff: PASS
- pytest: PASS (77 total tests, 13 new)

**Commit:** 7fbf034

## [2026-01-17] - CE-BP-003 - Implement template_renderer.py

**Implemented:**
- Created lib/template_renderer.py with Handlebars-style template rendering
- render_template(name, context) - Load and render template from blueprints/templates/
- render_template_string(template, context) - Render template string directly
- get_templates_dir() - Helper to get templates directory path
- Chose Chevron over pybars3 (simpler, well-maintained, Mustache-compatible)

**Files changed:**
- lib/template_renderer.py (new)
- tests/test_template_renderer.py (new)
- pyproject.toml (added chevron)
- uv.lock (updated)

**Learnings:**
- Chevron uses Mustache syntax, not full Handlebars (simpler)
- Loop syntax: {{#items}}{{.}}{{/items}} (not {{#each}})
- Conditional syntax: {{#condition}}...{{/condition}} (not {{#if}})
- Chevron escapes HTML entities by default (& becomes &amp;)
- Missing variables render as empty strings (graceful degradation)
- cast() needed for mypy since chevron.render returns Any
- type: ignore[import-untyped] needed for chevron import

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- Mustache {{.}} refers to current item in loop iteration
- {{^condition}} is inverted section (renders if false/empty)
- {{#items}} iterates over lists, {{#object}} checks truthiness
- Nested objects accessed with dot notation: {{user.name}}

**Tests:**
- 12 comprehensive tests covering:
  - Simple and complex templates
  - Loops, conditionals, nested objects
  - Error handling (file not found, missing variables)
  - HTML escaping behavior
  - Unicode support
- mypy: PASS
- ruff: PASS
- pytest: PASS (89 total tests, 12 new)

## [2026-01-17] - CE-BP-004 - Add Blueprint cache table to database

**Implemented:**
- Added Blueprint model to lib/database.py with all required fields
- id, name, category, platform (nullable), data (JSON), version, timestamps
- Created Alembic migration 4864d1c47cec
- Successfully ran migration to create blueprints table in SQLite

**Files changed:**
- lib/database.py (added Blueprint model, imported JSON from sqlalchemy)
- alembic/versions/4864d1c47cec_add_blueprint_table_for_blueprint_.py (new migration)
- tests/test_blueprint_model.py (new test file)

**Learnings:**
- SQLAlchemy JSON column type stores Python dicts/lists as JSON in SQLite
- Alembic --autogenerate correctly detects new model and generates migration
- setattr() avoids mypy assignment errors when updating Column attributes
- Platform field is nullable for workflows/constraints (only frameworks have platform)
- JSON data persists correctly including nested objects and arrays
- datetime.utcnow() generates deprecation warnings in SQLAlchemy (use datetime.now(UTC) in future)

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- Use SessionLocal() for database sessions, commit explicitly
- db.refresh() after commit to reload model with updated timestamps
- JSON column allows complex nested data structures
- Alembic migrations maintain schema version history

**Tests:**
- 8 comprehensive tests for Blueprint CRUD:
  - Create, read, update, delete operations
  - Query by category
  - NULL platform handling
  - Complex nested JSON persistence
  - repr method
- pytest: PASS (97 total tests, 8 new)

**Note:** Pre-existing mypy errors in database.py (Session name conflict) 
not addressed as they're unrelated to this story.

## [2026-01-17] - CE-BP-010 - Create BrandVoice.yaml constraint

**Implemented:**
- Created blueprints/constraints/BrandVoice.yaml with comprehensive brand voice definition
- 5 core characteristics with examples and guidelines:
  - technical_but_accessible
  - authentic
  - confident
  - builder_mindset
  - specificity_over_generic
- Forbidden phrases across 4 categories (40+ phrases to avoid)
- Style rules: narrative_voice, structure, tone, technical_communication
- Content principles (8 core principles)
- Validation flags: red_flags, yellow_flags, green_signals

**Files changed:**
- blueprints/constraints/BrandVoice.yaml (new)
- tests/test_brandvoice_constraint.py (new)

**Learnings:**
- YAML parsing errors from parenthetical comments outside quotes
- Constraints provide validation criteria for content generation
- Each characteristic includes both good and bad examples
- Forbidden phrases organized by category (easier to reason about)
- Validation flags provide graduated severity levels

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- Constraint blueprints differ from frameworks (validations vs structures)
- Examples in constraints use good/bad pairs for clarity
- load_constraints() function works same as load_framework()
- Cache key pattern: "constraint:{name}" vs "framework:{platform}:{name}"

**YAML gotchas fixed:**
- Cannot put parenthetical comments after quoted strings in list items
- Bad: `- "phrase" (comment here)` → YAML parse error
- Good: `- "phrase (comment here)"` → parsed correctly
- Simplified forbidden_phrases to just list strings without annotations

**Tests:**
- 10 comprehensive tests for BrandVoice constraint:
  - YAML loading and caching
  - Required fields validation
  - Characteristics structure (5 core IDs)
  - Forbidden phrases (4 categories)
  - Style rules (4 categories)
  - Content principles
  - Validation flags (red/yellow/green)
  - Examples structure (good/bad pairs)

## [2026-01-17] - CE-BP-011 - Create ContentPillars.yaml constraint

**Implemented:**
- Created blueprints/constraints/ContentPillars.yaml with comprehensive pillar definitions
- Four pillars with distribution: what_building (35%), what_learning (30%), sales_tech (20%), problem_solution (15%)
- Each pillar includes: name, description, percentage, examples, characteristics, themes
- Distribution rules: 3-7 posts/week, ideal 5, weekly balance tracking
- Validation rules: balance checks (±10% warning, ±20% error), min posts per pillar
- Content principles for pillar-framework mapping and rotation
- Balanced week example + poor balance example with fixes

**Files changed:**
- blueprints/constraints/ContentPillars.yaml (new)
- tests/test_contentpillars_constraint.py (new)
- scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated CE-BP-011 passes: true)

**Learnings:**
- Content pillars define topical distribution strategy (35%/30%/20%/15% balance)
- Each pillar has unique characteristics and themes for content categorization
- Distribution rules track over 7-day rolling window (not per-post)
- Validation severity levels: warning (±10%) vs error (±20%)
- Pillar determines framework choice pattern (e.g., what_building → STF/SLA)
- Examples show both ideal balance and common mistakes with fixes

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- Pillar percentage total validates to 100%
- Each pillar structure: name, description, percentage, examples, characteristics, themes
- Distribution tracking uses rolling window (weekly/monthly)
- Validation gradients: warning → error based on severity
- Content principles connect pillars to frameworks and guide rotation

## [2026-01-17] - CE-BP-012 - Implement blueprint_engine.py with validation

**Implemented:**
- Created lib/blueprint_engine.py with core validation engine
- validate_content(content, framework, platform) validates against framework + brand voice
- check_brand_voice(content) detects forbidden phrases from BrandVoice constraint
- select_framework(pillar, context) chooses appropriate framework based on pillar + context
- ValidationResult dataclass with is_valid, violations, warnings, suggestions, score

**Files changed:**
- lib/blueprint_engine.py (new)
- tests/test_blueprint_engine.py (new)
- scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated CE-BP-012 passes: true)

**Learnings:**
- Validation combines framework structure checks + brand voice constraints
- Score calculation: 1.0 - (violations * 0.2) - (warnings * 0.05)
- Framework selection uses default mapping + context-aware overrides
- Default mapping: what_building→STF, what_learning→MRS, sales_tech→STF, problem_solution→STF
- Context keywords override defaults: poll/question→PIF, mistake/failed→MRS
- Forbidden phrases match must be exact (case-insensitive) from YAML
- BrandVoice has 4 categories of forbidden phrases: corporate_jargon, hustle_culture, empty_motivational, vague_business_speak

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- ValidationResult dataclass provides structured validation output
- Violations are errors (must fix), warnings are suggestions (should fix)
- Score 0.0-1.0 indicates content quality (1.0 = perfect)
- Brand voice checking iterates through forbidden phrase categories
- Framework selection can be overridden by context keywords
- Case-insensitive matching for forbidden phrases using .lower()

**Tests:**
- 22 comprehensive tests for blueprint_engine:
  - validate_content with all 4 frameworks
  - Character length validation (min/max from YAML)
  - Score calculation and suggestions
  - Brand voice forbidden phrase detection (single/multiple)
  - Case-insensitive matching
  - Framework selection for all 4 pillars
  - Context-based framework overrides
  - ValidationResult dataclass structure
- pytest: PASS (188 total tests, 22 new)
- ruff: PASS (removed unused variable)
- mypy: PASS
